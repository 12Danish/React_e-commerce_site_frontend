# Construction site front end 

**This project is under development**

This is a REACT application frontend with typescript files made using vite connected to a Django-REST backend.

The project contains many framework dependant files.

The main code of the project is within the **src** folder.

## src folder structure
- **src -> assets** : Contains pictures and a placeholder data file
- **srcs -> components** : Has files for different components which make up the pages
- **src -> pages** : Has the layout for different pages
- **src -> app.tsx** : Decides which page to be rendered

## Setup Instructions

### Dependency:
The react project uses node version 18.16.0. It would work with later versions as well but this version is recommended to not encounter any issues.
- Pull the project to your working directory
- Open terminal and type :
  ```
  npm run dev
  ```

You can customise the components as needed and add pages as required.
